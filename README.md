# Accident-Prediction-Model-Using-BHM

### Abstract
This project is the result of an in-depth project on the paper "A novel Bayesian hi-erarchical model for road safety hotspot prediction" by Fawcett, Thorpe, Matthews& Kremer (2017). The model introduced by Fawcett et al. intends to enablepractitioners to take proactive road safety measures at specific sites by predict-ing the number of accidents and ranking them according to their safety hotspotpotentials. In contrast to previous models, the confounding effects of regression-to-mean and trend are met. Aim of this study project was to analyze the modeland to replicate it based on historical data of accident counts from the Germancity of Halle. As indicated in detail throughout the report, we were able to suc-cessfully replicate the model. With this report, we provide the reader with anoverview of the model by Fawcett et al., discuss our approach to model replica-tion, compare the results, and give an overall outlook including recommendationsto Fawcett et al. It is useful for everyone who intends to study the potentials andimplementations of Bayesian models as well as their practical applications.
